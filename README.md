# Deep Learning Tutorial

A simple setup for training MNIST in an interactive (Jupyter) notebook.

## Starting a session

First set up the workspace, adding some users:

    ./scripts/deploy prepare USER1 USER2 ...

Now start the server

    ./scripts/deploy start

You should now be able to go to `http://localhost` & log into your server
(for each account the password is just the username).
