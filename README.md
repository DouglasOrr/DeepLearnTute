# Deep Learning Tutorial

A simple setup for training MNIST in an interactive (Jupyter) notebook.

## Starting a session

Create a file `users` in the project root. This should contain:

    USER1:PASSWD1::::/work/USER1:
    USER2:PASSWD2::::/work/USER2:
    ...

Run the following (restarts the notebook server):

    ./scripts/notebook
