# Do-It-Yourself Deep Learning Tutorial in Chainer

We want to encourage you to do-it-yourself for this practical. But to make it achievable, we have done the following for you:

 - Chosen a problem to solve & found a dataset (hand-written character recognition).
 - Provided code for loading and displaying the dataset.
 - Set up a machine for development.
 - Documented an outline of a machine learning system, for your reference.
