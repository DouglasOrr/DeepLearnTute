# Do-It-Yourself Deep Learning Tutorial in Chainer

We want to encourage you to do-it-yourself in this practical. But to make it achievable in a couple of hours, we have done the following for you:

 - Chosen a problem to solve & found a dataset.
 - Provided code for loading and displaying the dataset.
 - Set up a machine for development.
 - Documented an outline of a machine learning system, for your reference (below).
 - Introduced some Chainer concepts for implementing your model (below).


## 1. The Problem


## 2. Getting Data


## 3. Defining a Model


## 4. Training the Model


## 5. Evaluating the Model
